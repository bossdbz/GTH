To construct the building copy the objects within the prefab,
adjust your snapping settings to 1 unit XZ and 0.5 unit Y.

If your using Unity Free it might be a good idea to combine the objects to reduce drawcalls.

The building comes with a custom shader to enable cubemap reflections in windows, but feel free to change it
to your liking.
