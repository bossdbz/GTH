Quick Start:

Create an empty game object and add the RainCreator script to it. Set the 'Rain Level' to 1
and move the game object to the position at which you want your rain to be instantiated.


Rain Creator Usage:

Rain Level: The amount of rain you want in your scene
	0 - Soft Rain, highest performance, small amount of rain
	1 - Normal Rain, medium performance, normal amount of rain (Recommended)
	2 - Heavy Rain, this can halve your frames per seconds (!!), highest amount of rain

Local Position: Position (local space) at which the rain will be instantiated
	If the RainCreator is parented to an first person camera I recommend setting the y-value to 9

Soft Rain, Rain, Heavy Rain: Rain prefabs, you won't need to change those
